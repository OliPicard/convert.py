<h1> Welcome to ConvertChair.py</h1>
ConvertChair.py is a port of the original Convert.py script for the Python 2.0 runtime.

<h3>Mission Goal</h3>
The idea of the project is to mirror Convert.py but be backwards compatible with other runtimes.

If your looking for a modern runtime, We recommend Convert.py. If your looking for an older client,
for iOS's Pythonista for example then ConvertChair.py is what your looking for.
