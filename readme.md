<h2>ConvertChair.py<h2>
ConvertChair.py (codename'd Comfy Chair) is a Python compatible runtime of the Convert.Py script.

It has it's own independent branch as we will be porting over the functionality from the main branch.

To use this version simply download the Python 2 runtime then launch the Python app either via command line or via IDLE. If running in IDLE be sure to press F5 to run the module.
